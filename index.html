			<!-- Introudction/Explanation of Idea -->
			<div id="introduction">
			<p>This website is a hybrid of presentation as well as what the app would possibly look like.
				This application was designed to help users find public events going on around them.
				This idea would include, <span id="features">distance from user, price, address, description, as well as pictures.</span>
				Now because this is just an idea it is hard to show what exaclty this app would be able to do.
				There would also be filters, and categories to help narrow down the search and what the user would
	 			be able to look for. The idea of including a small "upcoming" events calander has also been included.
			This is the Event Finder idea, as well as a small sample of the idea and what it would look like.</p>

				<!-- Paragraph 3/ Aligned Center -->
				<p id="idea">This idea what thought of when I was sitting at home and could not find anything to do. I wished there was something that would tell me what fun events were happening around me and in my area.
				I figured why not create an application that allows people to post local events for people to find and attend. You can find events based on search criteria (not yet developed) and filters to find an event suited to your desire.
				This idea was created by Michael Garza a freshman at the University of Houston.
